# Black March

Black March is a music band based in Toulouse, doing heavy metal. The website was intended to not only showcase the band's work but also serve as a platform to sell their various creations. Albums of course, but also t-shirts and other goodies. I went for a very straightforward solution in the name of [Paypal Buttons](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/). The integration was easy as everything is handled by Paypal itself. No custom database was required. A simple click-and-pay solution.

The website is built with Vue.js, which was a great help for organizing the code as several pages were necessary and thus components came in very handy. On top of that the framework allowed to create smooth page transitions without the need to use any external library.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout
- Music section with embedded SoundCloud player.
- Store section with Paypal Buttons.

## Assets

Black March are doing heavy metal, therefore the design had to follow along those lines. I opted for a black and white scheme with touches of brown. A single font is used throughout the entire design, the amazing [Freight Text Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/freight-text) by Joshua Darden. It is a serif font, elegant, engaging and with a touch of grandiloquence. It was necessary to play around with different sizes and weights in order to create variety in typography without having to add in another one.

## Thank you

This project was amazing to work on. It was my first time building with Vue.js and it felt great to see how the structure of the framework works, and how easy it is to organize the code within views and components. The vue logic is very satisfying to work with. I wish I could have implemented a custom solution for the payment handling, but as the store is currently pretty small, Paypal Buttons absolutely do the trick. Perhaps in the near future I shall go back to it and go more in-depth on the server side.

Thanks to the Black March crew for the trust they put in me and all the artists surrounding them for providing me great assets to work with.
